Clean layered architecture

Database migration (MySQL → PostgreSQL)

Cloud deployment using Docker

Environment-based configuration (industry standard)

🧠 Architecture Explanation

The project follows a layered architecture:

Controller Layer
Handles HTTP requests and responses (REST APIs).

Service Layer
Contains business logic and validation.

Repository Layer
Communicates with the database using Spring Data JPA.

Entity Layer
